To turn a newly created post into a full thread, the process involves **posting a series of tweets sequentially**, where each subsequent tweet includes the Tweet ID of the previous one in the `reply.in_reply_to_tweet_id` field. There is **no single batch API** to create an entire threadâ€”you must chain tweets manually. ([stackoverflow.com][1], [devcommunity.x.com][2])

## ðŸ§µ How to Build a Thread from a Create-Post Response

### 1. **Initial Post:**

* Send your HTTP `POST /2/tweets` request to create the first tweet.
* The API response includes a JSON structure:

  ```json
  {
    "data": {
      "id": "1234567890123456789",
      "text": "This is the first tweet."
    }
  }
  ```
* Extract `data.id` â€” this is your **root Tweet ID**.

### 2. **Chaining Replies:**

* For each tweet in your thread (after the first), issue another `POST /2/tweets` call.
* Include:

  ```json
  {
    "text": "Next tweet in the thread",
    "reply": {
      "in_reply_to_tweet_id": "<previousTweetId>"
    }
  }
  ```
* The API will create the new tweet as a reply to your previous oneâ€”forming a thread connection. ([community.make.com][3], [cborchers.com][4])

### 3. **General Flow:**

* **Tweet 1** â†’ API returns `id = 1001`.
* **Tweet 2** â†’ `reply`: `{ in_reply_to_tweet_id: 1001 }` â†’ API returns `id = 1002`.
* **Tweet 3** â†’ `reply` to `1002`, and so on.

### 4. **Error Handling:**

* If your first post returns errors (e.g. partial fields or other issues), check for errors in the API response.
* Only use the response `id` if the HTTP status is `2xx`.
* If the initial post failed, you should halt the thread publishing.
* For partial errors after a success, log details and decide if you should continue or retry.

## ðŸ›  Sample Pseudocode Flow

```text
function postThread(textsArray):
    previousId = null
    for each text in textsArray:
        payload = { text }
        if previousId:
            payload.reply = { in_reply_to_tweet_id: previousId }
        response = POST /2/tweets with payload
        if response.status not 2xx:
            log error; abort
        previousId = response.data.id
    end loop
```

## âœ… Summary

* Thereâ€™s **no batch thread endpoint**â€”you must **post tweets one by one**, chaining via `reply.in_reply_to_tweet_id`.
* Start with the first tweet, get its ID, then reply to it for each subsequent tweet.
* This approach is consistent with existing documentation and developer guidance. ([docs.tigest.club][5])
