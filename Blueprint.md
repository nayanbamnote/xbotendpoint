# Twitter Thread Scheduler MVP (Bearer‚ÄëToken + Raw HTTP)

## üéØ Overview

A lightweight Node.js service that accepts a webhook payload (an array of text tweets), schedules them for execution, and posts them sequentially as a thread using raw HTTP requests authenticated via a Bearer Token (OAuth 2.0 App-only).

## üöÄ Features

1. Accepts HTTP payload with a list of tweet texts.
2. Schedules execution via `setTimeout` (or simple scheduler).
3. Posts first tweet, then replies to previous tweet IDs to form a thread.
4. Runs on local host for rapid prototyping.


## üì® Authorization Header

Include in every request:
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN


Passing in the header ensures authenticated access to v2 endpoints :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

## üß± Architecture

### 1. **n8n Webhook Trigger**
- Sends a POST request to `http://localhost:<port>/schedule-thread` with JSON payload:
  ```json
  { 
    "texts": ["First tweet", "Second tweet", ‚Ä¶ up to 5], 
    "delayMs": 60000 
  }
  
2. Node.js Endpoint Handler
Validates incoming array.

Stores in local memory or minimal persistent store.

Schedules execution using setTimeout or other scheduler.

3. Thread Posting Logic
HTTP POST to https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets with JSON:
{ "text": "First tweet" }

Capture returned id from response.

For each subsequent tweet, send:{
  "text": "Next tweet",
  "reply": { "in_reply_to_tweet_id": "previousTweetId" }
}
Repeat sequentially to form the thread.

4. Error Handling & Logging
On HTTP error, retry with simple backoff.

Log success or failure, final tweet IDs, or error reason.

üîÅ Rate Limits & Auth Context
App-only Bearer Token is read-only; it cannot post tweets‚Äîattempts will be rejected with unauthorized error. Supported methods for posting require user context (OAuth‚ÄØ1.0a or OAuth‚ÄØ2.0 user token)

To post, you must use user context tokens, not just app-only Bearer Token.
